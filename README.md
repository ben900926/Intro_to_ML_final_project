# NYCU Intro to ML final project

This repository is the official implementation of 2022 NYCU intro to ML final project by 109550146 åŠ‰æ²›å‡¡

## Requirements

To install requirements, please run my ipynb file in google colab and execute the first cell

>ðŸ“‹  Please use the latest version of Google Colab and run the first cell

## Link to My Model

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My logistic regression model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5d3PfMkJr7ln3xu5xQbZQsqlqqInJbq/view?usp=share_link) trained using parameter search.

## Reproducing Submission
To reproduce my submission, follow the steps below:

*Note: Please download my ipynb code and open it on Google Colab. **Don't open it directly in Github.***

1. Run 109550146_Final_train.ipynb (You can skip this if you use the model I provided above)
2. Run 109550146_Final_inference.ipynb
3. Following "SUBMISSION_PATH" to download my **109550146_submission.csv** file. By default, it can be found here:
4. Submit it to Kaggle

## Training

To train the model, run 109550146_Final_train.ipynb. Remember to execute all cells in order!

There are two parameters you should note while running my training code

 - MODEL_WEIGHT_PATH: This is where the code would store the weight of trained model. 
 The default path (drive/MyDrive/ml_final/model/final_model.pkl) is the path in my drive storing the weight file I provided. 
 **You should change the path to your own.**
 You can find this file following the link in the "Pre-trained Models" section.

 - PARA_SEARCH: This is to determine whether the parameter search is enabled. Default is set to "False", so that the best parameter I found is used. 
  If you want to take a look of how I do parameter search, you can enable it, but the result model might be different than the one I used for this project.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model, run 109550146_Final_inference.ipynb in Google Colab. All cell should be executed in order.

**Note**: You should change the path to the model weight if you want to offer a new file to it.

By default, my model weight is automatically downloaded to Google Colab in the first cell, 
so you don't have to change anything if you want to use the model I provided.

Also, the submission file is stored in SUBMISSION_PATH, so by default you should see **"109550146_submission.csv"** by clicking this button in left.

You can change the path if you want to store it in your drive.


## Results

My model achieves the following performance on :
